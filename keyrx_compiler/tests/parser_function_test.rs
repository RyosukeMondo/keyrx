//! Unit tests for DSL functions (map, tap_hold, helpers, when, when_not, device)

//! These tests verify that each DSL function works correctly in isolation.

//! This test suite has been refactored into focused modules under parser_test/
//! for better maintainability and to comply with the 500-line file size limit.
