# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec core-config-system. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

Perfect! Task 8 has been completed successfully. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Task 8 Complete: Error Types Module ✓

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created comprehensive error types module in `keyrx_compiler/src/error.rs`
- Defined 3 error enums:
  - **ParseError**: 9 variants covering syntax errors, prefix validation, imports, and resource limits
  - **SerializeError**: 2 variants for rkyv and I/O errors
  - **DeserializeError**: 5 variants for magic bytes, version, hash validation, and rkyv errors
- Implemented `Display` and `Error` traits for all error types
- Added `From<std::io::Error>` conversions for ergonomic error handling
- Created 15 unit tests achieving 100% coverage for the error module

**Quality Metrics:**
- ✅ All 15 tests passing
- ✅ 100% coverage for error.rs (39/39 lines)
- ✅ 96.36% workspace coverage (53/55 lines)
- ✅ Clippy clean with `-D warnings`
- ✅ Code formatted with rustfmt

**Committed:**
- Commit: `741f1c1` - "feat(compiler): add comprehensive error types module"
- Implementation logged to spec workflow

The error types are now ready to be used by the parser, serializer, and other compiler modules in subsequent tasks.
