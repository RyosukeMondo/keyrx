# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec core-config-system. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! The commit was successful with all tests passing. Task 20 is now complete. The integration tests provide comprehensive coverage of all CLI commands including:

- **31 integration tests** covering compile, verify, hash, and parse commands
- Tests for success scenarios and error handling
- Validation of output formats (both human-readable and JSON)
- Tests for corrupted files, missing files, and invalid syntax
- Help command tests for all subcommands
- Edge cases like empty configs and multiple devices

All tests are passing and the code meets quality standards.
