# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec core-config-system. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! The commit was successful. The fuzzer created a corpus of test cases (878 files) that discovered interesting inputs during the 60-second run. This corpus will be used in future fuzzing runs to build on the coverage already achieved.

Task 22 has been completed successfully:
- ✅ Added `parse_string()` method to Parser for fuzzing support
- ✅ Created fuzz target `fuzz_parser.rs` in keyrx_core/fuzz/fuzz_targets/
- ✅ Configured keyrx_core/fuzz as a separate workspace
- ✅ Added keyrx_compiler dependency to fuzz package
- ✅ Successfully ran fuzzer for 60+ seconds with 50K+ test cases
- ✅ No crashes or panics discovered
- ✅ Generated corpus of 872 interesting test cases
- ✅ Code formatted and committed

The parser handles all arbitrary input gracefully, returning errors instead of panicking, which is exactly what we want for robustness and security.
