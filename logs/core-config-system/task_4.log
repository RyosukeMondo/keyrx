# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec core-config-system. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 6 is complete. I have successfully:

1. ✅ Defined the `Metadata` struct with:
   - `compilation_timestamp` (u64) - Unix timestamp
   - `compiler_version` (String) - Compiler version information  
   - `source_hash` (String) - SHA256 hash of source Rhai scripts

2. ✅ Defined the `ConfigRoot` struct with:
   - `version` (Version) - Binary format version
   - `devices` (Vec<DeviceConfig>) - Device-specific configurations
   - `metadata` (Metadata) - Compilation metadata

3. ✅ Both structs use `#[repr(C)]` for stable binary layout

4. ✅ Both structs derive all required rkyv traits: `Archive`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`

5. ✅ Added comprehensive documentation comments

6. ✅ Verified the code compiles successfully

7. ✅ Committed the changes with proper git messages

The next task (task 7) is to write unit tests for all the config data structures. This will help improve the test coverage and verify that all the structures work correctly with serialization/deserialization.
