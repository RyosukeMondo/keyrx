# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec core-config-system. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 5 is now complete and committed. The DeviceIdentifier and DeviceConfig structs have been successfully implemented with:

1. ✅ DeviceIdentifier struct with `pattern` field (String)
2. ✅ DeviceConfig struct with `identifier` and `mappings` fields
3. ✅ Both structs use #[repr(C)] for stable binary layout
4. ✅ Both derive all required rkyv traits (Archive, Serialize, Deserialize)
5. ✅ Documentation explaining device identifier pattern format
6. ✅ Code compiles successfully
7. ✅ Changes committed to git

The implementation is complete and ready for the next task.
