# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec ai-dev-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 3 (build.sh) has been completed successfully. The implementation includes:

**Completed:**
- ✅ Comprehensive build.sh script with all required features
- ✅ Debug and release mode support (--release flag)
- ✅ Watch mode with cargo-watch integration (--watch flag)
- ✅ Common flags: --error, --json, --quiet, --log-file
- ✅ Epoch-timestamped logging to scripts/logs/
- ✅ Status markers: === accomplished ===, === failed ===
- ✅ JSON output mode for automation
- ✅ Proper exit codes (0=success, 1=failure, 2=missing tool)
- ✅ Help documentation with examples
- ✅ All functionality tested and validated
- ✅ Implementation logged in spec-workflow system
- ✅ Committed to git with clear message

The script successfully builds the workspace in both debug and release modes, outputs proper status markers and JSON when requested, and integrates cleanly with the common.sh library for consistent logging and argument parsing.
