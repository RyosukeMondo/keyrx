# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec ai-dev-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 5.1 has been completed and committed. The GitHub Actions release workflow is now in place. It will:

1. Trigger automatically when version tags matching `v*.*.*` are pushed
2. Build release binaries on both Linux and Windows platforms
3. Create GitHub releases with the compiled binaries attached (keyrx_compiler and keyrx_daemon for both platforms)
4. Use proper caching to speed up builds
5. Separate the build and release creation into distinct jobs for better organization

The workflow follows the same patterns as the existing CI workflow and meets all the requirements from the task specification.
