# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! I've successfully completed tasks 2 and 2.1 from the ai-dev-foundation spec:

## Completed Work:

### Task 2: Create script library with common functions
- Created `scripts/lib/common.sh` with comprehensive utilities
- Implemented logging functions: `log_info`, `log_error`, `log_warn`, `log_debug`
- Added status markers: `log_accomplished`, `log_failed`, `log_warning_marker`
- Implemented argument parsing: `parse_common_flags` (handles --quiet, --json, --error, --log-file)
- Added exit code checker: `check_exit_code`
- Implemented timestamp functions: `get_timestamp`, `get_epoch_timestamp`
- Created log file manager: `setup_log_file`
- Added JSON formatters: `output_json`, `json_object`, `json_array`
- Added utility functions: `command_exists`, `require_tool`, `separator`
- All functions properly tested and working

### Task 2.1: Create scripts/logs/ directory structure
- Created `scripts/logs/.gitkeep` to track directory in git
- Verified `*.log` files are ignored by .gitignore
- Centralized location for epoch-timestamped script execution logs

Both commits have been made with clear, descriptive messages following the project conventions.
