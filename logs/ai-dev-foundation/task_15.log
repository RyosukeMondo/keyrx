# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec ai-dev-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 7 has been completed and committed successfully. The root Makefile is now in place with all the required targets (help, build, verify, test, launch, clean, setup), providing a simple top-level interface for common development operations.

The implementation:
- Uses `.PHONY` targets as required
- Sets the default goal to `help` 
- Suppresses command echo with `@` prefix for cleaner output
- Delegates to the respective scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Provides a `setup` target that installs all development tools and git hooks
- Provides a `clean` target that safely removes only build artifacts

All targets work correctly and the Makefile follows best practices for Make-based project orchestration.
