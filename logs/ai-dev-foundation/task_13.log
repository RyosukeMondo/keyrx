# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 6 is now complete. The comprehensive scripts/CLAUDE.md documentation has been created and committed. 

The documentation includes:
- Script reference table with all 5 scripts
- Detailed output format specifications (status markers, log formats, JSON schemas)
- Complete flag reference for all common and script-specific flags
- 30+ example commands covering all use cases
- Comprehensive failure scenarios with solutions
- Extensive troubleshooting guide with Q&A format
- AI agent integration guidance

This serves as the single source of truth for all script usage, making it easy for both human developers and AI agents to discover and use all script capabilities effectively.
