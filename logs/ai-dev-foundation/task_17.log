Work on the single next task for spec ai-dev-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 8.2 has been completed successfully. The AI agent autonomous workflow simulation test is now implemented and working. 

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **Task 8.2 - Validate AI agent autonomous workflow**. This comprehensive E2E test simulates a complete AI agent development cycle:

### What the simulation does:

1. **Reads documentation** - Verifies .claude/CLAUDE.md exists and contains essential sections for AI onboarding
2. **Verifies environment** - Runs `make build` to ensure the workspace is ready
3. **Creates new module** - Generates `keyrx_core/src/ai_test_module.rs` with properly documented functions
4. **Detects missing tests** - Runs `make verify` which fails due to missing test coverage
5. **Adds comprehensive tests** - Creates `keyrx_core/tests/ai_test_module_test.rs` with 9 test cases
6. **Passes quality checks** - Re-runs verification (build, clippy, fmt, tests) which now passes
7. **Verifies pre-commit hook** - Confirms the automated quality gate is properly configured

### Key features:

- **Fully autonomous** - Simulates AI workflow without human intervention
- **Self-cleaning** - Automatically removes all test artifacts after completion
- **Colored output** - Clear visual feedback with status indicators
- **Comprehensive validation** - Tests the entire AI development foundation

The simulation successfully validates that the AI development foundation enables fully autonomous development! 🎉
