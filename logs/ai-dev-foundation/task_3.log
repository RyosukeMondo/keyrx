# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 1.4 is complete. I've successfully:

1. ✅ Initialized keyrx_ui frontend project using Vite with React and TypeScript template
2. ✅ Configured vite.config.ts for WASM integration with vite-plugin-wasm
3. ✅ Created the required directory structure (components/, wasm/, hooks/)
4. ✅ Updated App.tsx with a clean KeyRX placeholder UI
5. ✅ Created comprehensive README.md documenting development workflow
6. ✅ Verified the build works successfully
7. ✅ Committed all changes with proper git message
8. ✅ Logged the implementation with detailed artifacts

The keyrx_ui frontend is now set up and ready for future WASM integration with keyrx_core. The project has React 18+, TypeScript 5+, and vite-plugin-wasm configured as specified in the requirements.
