# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec ai-dev-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! I've completed the first task successfully. I've created:

1. **Task 1 (Completed)**: Root Cargo workspace with 4-crate configuration
   - Configured workspace resolver 2 and Rust edition 2021
   - Defined workspace-level dependencies
   - Set up release/dev/bench profiles

2. **Task 1.1 (Completed)**: keyrx_core library crate
   - Configured as no_std with alloc for WASM compatibility
   - Added all required dependencies (rkyv, boomphf, fixedbitset, arrayvec)
   - Created placeholder modules (config, lookup, dfa, state, simulator)
   - Set up benches/ and fuzz/ infrastructure
   - Added comprehensive README

3. **Task 1.2 (Completed)**: keyrx_compiler binary crate
   - Configured clap for CLI with derive macros
   - Added dependencies (rhai, serde, clap)
   - Created placeholder modules (parser, mphf_gen, dfa_gen, serialize)
   - Set up integration tests directory
   - Added comprehensive README

All work has been committed with clear, atomic commits. The next task would be Task 1.3: Initialize keyrx_daemon binary crate, which is more complex as it requires platform-specific features and web server configuration.
