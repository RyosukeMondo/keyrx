# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec ai-dev-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! The .gitignore is working perfectly:
- `target/` directory is being ignored (not shown in git status)
- `Cargo.lock` is being ignored (not shown in git status)
- Only the implementation logs and logs directory are showing as untracked, which is expected

## Summary

✅ **Task 1.5 completed successfully**

I created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file at `/home/rmondo/repos/keyrx2/.gitignore` that covers:

1. **Rust build artifacts**: `target/`, `Cargo.lock`
2. **Node.js artifacts**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.vite/`
3. **Log files**: `scripts/logs/*.log`
4. **OS-specific files**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`
5. **IDE files**: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`, and other editor temporaries
6. **Backup files**: `*.bak`, `*.tmp`

The changes have been committed with a clear message and the implementation has been logged to the spec workflow system. The .gitignore is verified to be working correctly - build artifacts are properly ignored by git.
